      <strong className="mt-10">Why Convert PDF to JPG?</strong>
      <p className="mt-2">
        PDF (Portable Document Format) is a universal file format ideal for
        sharing and archiving documents, combining text, images, and graphics in
        a single file. However, converting PDFs to JPG (Joint Photographic
        Experts Group) images can be useful when you need to embed or share
        individual pages, particularly when dealing with visual content. JPGs
        are widely supported across various platforms and devices, making them
        ideal for online sharing and presentations.
